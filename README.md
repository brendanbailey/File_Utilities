# File_Utilities
**Basic file utilities for data munging. There are three main scripts with in this repo.**

**field_splitter** - takes a tab delimited text file and allows you to split into multiple files based on the values within a field.

**file_auditor** - This script audits all files in a directory. The audit produces a tab delimited report showing the cover and count for all fields and a 20 record sample in each file. This script was refactored by George Jansen.

**file_splitter** - The script takes a tab delimited text file and allows you to split into a number of files that the user designates. The files are relatively equal size.
